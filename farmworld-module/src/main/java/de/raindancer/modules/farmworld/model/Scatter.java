/**
 * Where in a farm world somebody is put down.
 *
 * <h2>Why arrivals are scattered at all, and why this is the module's most important value</h2>
 * A farm world exists so that the ground people dig up is ground nobody minds losing. Send everybody
 * to the same coordinates and that is exactly what it stops being: the first hundred blocks around
 * the arrival point are bare within a day, and from then on every player who arrives walks for five
 * minutes before they can do the thing they came to do. The farm world is then a corridor rather than
 * a farm world, and the only fix a server owner has left is to regenerate it more often — which
 * throws away everybody's work to solve a problem that was never about the far parts of the map.
 *
 * <p>So arriving somewhere different each time is not a nicety on top of a farm world. It is what
 * makes one work, which is why it is a value with its own tests rather than two lines inside a
 * teleport.
 *
 * <h2>Why the picking is here rather than in the service that teleports</h2>
 * Because it is arithmetic, and arithmetic that is wrong in a way nobody sees. Picked naively — an
 * angle and a radius both uniform — arrivals cluster hard at the middle: half of them land within
 * half the radius, which covers a quarter of the ground. That is the bug this class exists to not
 * have, and the only way to know it is absent is to draw ten thousand points and count them, which
 * needs no server and therefore happens on every build.
 *
 * @param enabled  whether to scatter at all; off, everybody arrives at the world's own spawn
 * @param nearest  how close to the middle anybody may land. Not zero by default: the middle is where
 *                 the portals, the roads and whatever an admin built are, and those are the one part
 *                 of a farm world worth keeping
 * @param furthest how far out anybody may land. Also how much world the server generates over the
 *                 life of the farm world, which is the cost nobody sees until the disk is full
