 * Which farm worlds exist, when each was last made — and what may be deleted.

 * <h2>Why the deletion rules live here, as a pure function</h2>
 * Regenerating a farm world deletes a directory. Everything else in this library can be wrong and
 * cost somebody an evening; this can be wrong and cost them their server. {@link #mayDelete} is
 * therefore separate from the code that deletes, takes no state, and is tested against every mistake
 * somebody could plausibly make with a command: a path outside the server, a path that climbs out
 * with {@code ..}, a folder that is not the world it claims to be, a folder that is not a world at
 * all, and the server directory itself.
 *
 * <p>It is deliberately suspicious rather than merely correct. A rule that only allows what is
 * obviously safe will occasionally refuse something harmless; a rule that only forbids what is
 * obviously dangerous will eventually allow something that is not.
