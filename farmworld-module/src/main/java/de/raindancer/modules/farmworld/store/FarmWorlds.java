/**
 * Farm worlds, as the server has them: created, linked, and thrown away when their time is up.
 *
 * <h2>What is here and what is not</h2>
 * Only what needs a server. {@link WorldSet} decides what the worlds are called, which belong
 * together, where a portal in one should lead and when the set is due; {@link FarmWorldState}
 * remembers all that and — critically — decides what may be deleted. This does the doing.
 *
 * <h2>Regenerating, in order</h2>
 * The order is the whole of it, and each step exists because skipping it breaks something:
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Move everybody out</b>, to the main world's spawn. A player left in a world being
 *       unloaded is a player in a world that no longer exists.</li>
 *   <li><b>Unload, saving nothing.</b> Saving a world that is about to be deleted writes chunks to
 *       disk for the pleasure of deleting them a moment later, and on a large farm world that is a
 *       visible freeze.</li>
 *   <li><b>Delete the folder</b>, and only after {@link FarmWorldState#mayDelete} has agreed.</li>
 *   <li><b>Create it again</b>, with a new seed.</li>
 * </ol>
 * If any step fails, the ones after it do not run. A half-regenerated farm world is recoverable; a
 * deleted-but-not-recreated one is a server with a hole in it.
 *
 * <h2>Threading</h2>
 * Creating, unloading and deleting a world are main-thread operations in Paper and are not safe
 * anywhere else, so everything here expects to be on it. That is also why regeneration is something
 * a server owner schedules for a quiet hour rather than something that happens mid-fight: it stops
 * the server for as long as the disk takes.
