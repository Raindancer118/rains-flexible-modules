/**
 * Keeps a farm world's portals inside the farm world.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists</h2>
 * It is the entire reason a farm world has its own nether. Without it, a portal lit in the farm
 * world leads to the <em>main</em> nether: people mine there instead, and the farm world protects
 * nothing at all — which is the exact thing it was built to do.
 *
 * <p>Only portals in worlds we manage are touched. Every other portal on the server behaves as it
 * always did, which matters because a listener that quietly redirects somebody else's portals is
 * far worse than one that misses a few of ours.
 *
 * <p>Remembers nothing about a player, so {@link #forget} is empty — a portal is a fact about a
 * place, not about who walked through it.
