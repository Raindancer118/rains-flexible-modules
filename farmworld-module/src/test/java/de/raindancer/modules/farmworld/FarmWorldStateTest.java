/**
 * What is remembered about a farm world between restarts, and what may be deleted.
 *
 * <h2>Why the deletion rules are tested this hard</h2>
 * Regenerating a farm world deletes a directory. Everything else in this library can be wrong and
 * cost somebody an evening; this can be wrong and cost them their server. So the check that a path
 * is one we are allowed to remove is a pure function with its own tests, and it is deliberately
 * suspicious: it refuses anything outside the server directory, anything that is not a world folder
 * we manage, and anything reached through a link.
