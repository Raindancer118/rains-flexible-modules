/**
 * Where people land, which is the arithmetic that decides whether the farm world works.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is drawn ten thousand times rather than asserted once</h2>
 * Because the bug it is looking for is not a wrong answer, it is a wrongly distributed one — and no single
 * point can be wrong. Picked naively, with the radius drawn straight from the generator, half of all arrivals
 * land inside half the radius, which is a quarter of the ground: the middle is stripped bare in a week and the
 * outer ring is never touched. Every individual coordinate would look perfectly reasonable.
 *
 * <p>So the test counts. Ten thousand points is enough that the inner and outer halves of the ring have to come
 * out close to their share of the area, and cheap enough to run on every build.
