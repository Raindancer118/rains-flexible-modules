/**
 * A warp: somewhere with a name that a player can be sent to.
 *
 * <h2>Why this wraps a {@link Poi} rather than replacing it</h2>
 * A warp <em>is</em> a place with a name, a world and coordinates — which is what a POI is, down to
 * the "the world is a name, not a World" reasoning and the handling of a world that is not loaded.
 * Writing that twice would mean two answers to every one of those questions and two files to keep in
 * step. So the place is the POI and this adds only what a warp actually has on top of one: who may
 * use it and what it is filed under.
 *
 * <p>The practical payoff is that everything which already understands places understands warps: a
 * ghast line can fly to one, a menu can list them beside homes, and deleting a world takes its warps
 * with it — none of which would work if a warp were a second store that happened to look the same.
 * {@link de.raindancer.core.world.poi.PoiStore} is Core's, shared with every module that stores a
 * named place; the meaning of a warp specifically is this module's.
