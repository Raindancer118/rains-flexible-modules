/**
 * Named places anybody can be sent to — this module's own, kept on Core's shared
 * {@link PoiStore} rather than a second store of its own.
 *
 * <h2>Why this has no store of its own</h2>
 * Because there already is one, and a warp is not a different kind of thing from a home or a ghast
 * stop — it is a place with a name, a world and coordinates. So a warp is a {@link Poi} of kind
 * {@code warp}, and persistence, atomic writes, worlds that are not loaded and "is this reachable"
 * are already solved and already tested, on {@code context.core().places()}. What is left is what a
 * warp actually adds: who may use one, how often, and how they are listed.
 *
 * <p>That is not only tidiness. It means everything which already understands places understands
 * warps: a ghast line can fly somebody to one, a menu can list them beside homes, and deleting a
 * world takes its warps with it. None of that would work if warps were a second store that happened
 * to look the same.
 *
 * <h2>Thread safety</h2>
 * Safe from any thread. The places are the {@link PoiStore}'s problem and it is already safe; the
 * cooldowns are Core's {@link Cooldowns}.
