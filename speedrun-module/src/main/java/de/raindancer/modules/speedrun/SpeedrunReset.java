/**
 * Throws a world away and makes it again, for a fresh attempt at a run.
 *
 * <h2>Why this does not use {@code FarmWorlds}</h2>
 * The steps are the same — evacuate, unload without saving, delete deepest-first, recreate — because
 * they are the only safe order there is (see {@code FarmWorlds}'s javadoc for why each one exists).
 * But {@code FarmWorlds}'s version is wired into {@code WorldSet} and {@code FarmWorldState}: which
 * worlds belong to a set, whether a folder may be deleted at all, when a set is due. None of that
 * applies to a speedrun map, which is one world with no bookkeeping of its own, so this is a small
 * self-contained copy of the pattern rather than a reuse of the machinery around it.
 *
 * <h2>Threading</h2>
 * Main thread only, exactly like {@code FarmWorlds.regenerate} — creating, unloading and deleting a
 * world are main-thread operations in Paper.
