/**
 * Pauses a run's clock while every participant is offline, and resumes it the moment one comes back.
 *
 * <h2>Why the host registers this rather than {@link SpeedrunSession} doing it</h2>
 * Same reasoning as {@code TravelListener} (see its javadoc): a library that registers its own
 * listeners is a library whose behaviour cannot be switched off. A caller who wants a run that keeps
 * timing while everybody is offline — unusual, but not this class's decision to make — simply does not
 * register it.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * SpeedrunSession session = new SpeedrunSession(participants);
 * getServer().getPluginManager().registerEvents(new SpeedrunOccupancyListener(session), this);
