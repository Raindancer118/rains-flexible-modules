/**
 * Joins, clicks and quits, for the one speedrun lobby.
 *
 * <h2>What a join does, and when</h2>
 * Only when both are true: {@link SpeedrunLobby#state()} is {@link SpeedrunLobbyState#READY}, <em>and</em>
 * the player is joining into the configured lobby world. Checking only the first was a real incident, not
 * a hypothetical one: on a shared server the lobby is READY almost all the time, and without the world
 * check every single join — into whatever world the server actually spawns people in — was cleared and
 * handed the two lobby items. Ordinary players lost their own gear simply by logging in. A player arriving
 * mid-run, mid-countdown, mid-pause, or into a finished round waiting to reset keeps whatever they were
 * carrying regardless, for the original reason: clearing a spectator's inventory to hand them a compass
 * and a block that does nothing useful yet would be a worse surprise than leaving them alone.
 *
 * <h2>Why the start block does not fix its own participant list</h2>
 * "Everybody currently in the lobby world" is read at the moment of the click, not kept as a
 * roster somebody joins and leaves — the same reasoning {@code FarmWorlds} scatters arrivals rather
 * than pre-registering them. A player who wandered into the lobby world without ever taking the
 * compass off it (dropped, given away) still races if they are standing there when somebody else
 * presses start; that is the whole point of a shared lobby.
 *
 * <h2>Why the inventory is cleared as soon as the countdown begins, not once the run starts</h2>
 * {@link SpeedrunLobby#beginCountdown} freezes participants for a few seconds first — see
 * {@link SpeedrunCountdown} — and there is nothing useful either item can still do once that starts:
 * the menu would only offer to reconfigure a run already under way, and the block cannot be pressed
 * twice into one run. Clearing it now rather than at zero also means the items are gone for the
 * whole countdown, not just visible props for it.
