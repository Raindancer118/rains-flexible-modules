/**
 * One live speedrun: a roster, a clock, and whatever is watching for the moment it ends.
 *
 * <h2>The one thing that has to be right</h2>
 * A run finishes <em>once</em>. Two advancement events for the same run arriving a millisecond apart
 * — plausible when two participants complete the same trigger together — must not stop the timer
 * twice or announce the finish twice. Exactly the same problem as {@code Achievements.award}, and
 * solved the same way: the outcome is written with one atomic compare-and-set, and only the caller
 * that wins it does anything.
