/**
 * A stopwatch. Nothing else — no lifecycle beyond running or not, no notion of why it started or
 * stopped. Full run lifecycle ({@code NOT_STARTED}/{@code PAUSED}/{@code FINISHED}) belongs on
 * {@link SpeedrunSession}; this only measures time.
 *
 * <h2>Why {@code System.nanoTime()}, not {@code Instant}</h2>
 * The clock is read from a display tick (once a second, to show elapsed time on a boss bar or
 * scoreboard) and mutated from event handlers — an advancement, a death, somebody logging out —
 * which on Paper can be a different thread from the tick. {@code nanoTime()} is monotonic and immune
 * to the wall clock being adjusted mid-run; {@code Instant.now()} is not, and a run that spans a
 * server's NTP correction would otherwise report a wrong duration.
 *
 * <h2>Thread safety</h2>
 * {@code synchronized} methods, matching the rest of this library's mutable-but-rarely-contended
 * state (see {@code Achievements}). A speedrun timer is touched a handful of times a second at most,
 * so there is nothing here that a lock costs anything to protect.
